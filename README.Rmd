`LIDIF` is designed to detect differential item functioning (DIF) in binary and/or ordinal items.

Here we provide a sample with details on how to estimate DIF coefficients, variance, predict the latent variable and visualize DIF effects in categorical variables.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LIDIF like so:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(devtools)

## install LIDIF function

## install_github("ZelingH/LIDIF")
library(LIDIF)
```


# Sample Data

`LIDIF` comes with a simulated data set.

```{r}
# load sample data
data(binsurvs)
```

The sample data consists of two parts. The first part contains the binary items:

```{r}
head(binsurvs$X)
```

The second part is the covariate information. We are interested in testing the DIF effects for both `sex` and `age`. The continuous covariate `age` has been standarded. 

```{r}
head(binsurvs$Z)

```


## Prepare the data

In the first step, we sort our sample data into the format of  `LIDIF` function input.

```{r}
surv.list = prepare_data(X = binsurvs$X, # item matrix
                         Z = binsurvs$Z # covariates matrix
                         )
```


**surv.list** is a list of two components.

## Run LIDIF function

The `LIDIF` function takes the `surv.list` as the model input and you need to specify the types of items (binary or ordinal) in `type_list` arguments. To improve computational efficiency, `LIDIF` leverages the benefits of parallel computation and you can specify the number of computing cores in `cl_num`.

Below is the estimating procedures in `LIDIF`. To ensure estimation accuracy, LIDIF has a built-in random initialization procedure. You can skip the random initialization by specifying your own starting point in `init_input`. In random initialization, the default number of repeated samples `init_nums` (m) $=30$, iterations `init_maxit` (k) $= 5$ and the percentage of sampling  `random_per` = $0.05$. These default setting yields accurate estimation results in our simulation studies (1000 samples with 5 items). If you have fewer observations, increasing `random_per` is recommended.

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
res = LIDIF(dat.list = surv.list,
            cl_num = 2, # number of cores
            type_list = "binary", # item type
            maxit = 5, # m = 1
            random_per = 0.5, # number of random samples
            init_nums = 10, # k = 2
            init_maxit = 1)
```


`LIDIF` function returns a list:

Estimated coefficients:
```{r}
res$coefficients
```

Estimated variance:
```{r}
res$variance
```

and the estimated variance-covariance matrix:
```{r, results='hide'}
res$cov
```


## Inference of the DIF

Testing for individual DIF effects:

```{r}
summary_LIDIF(res)

```

Testing for combined uniform and non-uniform DIF effects for sex:

```{r}
summary_LIDIF(res, terms = "sex")
```

## Predict the latent variable

With the output from `LIDIF` function, we could predict the latent variable via the posterior mean and its variance via the posterior variance.

```{r}
pred = predict_LIDIF(dat.list = surv.list,
              coefs_list = res$coefficients)

```


The histogram of posterior mean:
```{r}
hist(pred$est_mean, main = "Histogram of the Latent Variable (Posterior Mean)")

```


## Item Characteristic Curves (ICC)

Plot the DIF effects for sex using ICC curves:

```{r}
# specify the covariate matrix
tt = cbind("age"= c(mean(surv.list$Z[,"age"]),mean(surv.list$Z[,"age"])), # age is set as population average
           "sex" = c(0,1))


getICC(res$coefficients,
       cov_mat = tt,
       compare_var = "sex",
       type_list = "binary")
```
